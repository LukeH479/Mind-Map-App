# Mind-Map-App
This App aims to give the user the option to create their own mindmaps within an application. It should be flexible enough to allow the user to design and position elements as they wish but also allow the user to simply add information and let the software lay it out for them
Future versions of the app should incorporate AI/machine learning to create mindmaps based of information given.
